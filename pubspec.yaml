    - assets/images/Megan Pelto Illustration.png
    - assets/images/—Pngtree—hand drawn cartoon computer video_5364437.png
    - assets/images/lol.png
    - assets/images/Isometric _ Icons.png
    - assets/video/Intro.mp4
    - assets/video/Current.mp4
    - assets/video/Voltage.mp4
    - assets/video/Resistance.mp4
    - assets/images/—Pngtree—hand drawn cartoon computer s_5364478.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Pacifico
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/WorkSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 700
